There're multiply ways of find prime number. The obvious one would be something like this

int limit = 1000;

for(int i = 2; i < limit; i++){
    if(isPrime(i))
        System.out.print(i + " ");
}

public boolean isPrime(int i){
    int counter = 2;
    while(counter < i){
        if(i % counter  == 0)
            return false;
    }
    return true;
}

but that's super slow. The worst case running time would be O(n^2)

There're faster way of doing it. They're called Sieve Of Eratosthenes and Sieve of Atkin.
